# Motivation

I've started this project in an effort to better understand how to implement protocols on top of a transport layer along with getting more comfortable with lower level programming.

In addition to this, I'd like to leverage techniques I learned when studying domain specific languages: lexing, parsing, and interpretation.

The `notes` folder will hold the sum total of my learning as I continue along.
